How to run the script:

Make sure you've placed Canyon_Scripts folder in root of sandbox or wherever you keep your anomalyDetection folder

Run python3 rscript.py

Let it run - you'll get some broken files but the ones towards the end are useful
Naming convention is based on the source and test files and the time the mapping was run

Outputs will be put into the output folder in the Canyon_Scripts directory
