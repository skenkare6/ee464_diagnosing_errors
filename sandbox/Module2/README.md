Command to run module 2:
>> python3 module2.py --mode <execution mode>

The execution mode options are testselection or redrawmappings

Things to do:
- pass in an argument into module2.py that specifies codebase name so that changing directories doesn't have to be hardcoded
- Need to find an alternate to the source() method in contextLineNumber.R
- Call source-to-test from within module2.py function redrawmappings()
